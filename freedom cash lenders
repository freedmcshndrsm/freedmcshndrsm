For example, a company that is attempting to meet its payroll obligations might use cash flow finance to pay its employees now and pay back the loan and any interest on the profits and revenues generated by the employees on a future date. These loans do not require any type of physical collateral like property or assets but some or all of the cash flows used in the underwriting process are usually secured.

To underwrite cash flow loans, lenders examine expected future company incomes, its credit rating, and its enterprise value. The advantage of this method is that a company can possibly obtain financing much faster, as an appraisal of collateral is not required. Institutions usually underwrite cash flow-based loans using EBITDA (a companyâ€™s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) along with a credit multiplier.
